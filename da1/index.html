<ul>
  <li>It is using Phaser very poorly to do the dig.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<ul>
  <li>This prototype has allowed me to learn the basics of the Phaser engine.</li>
  <li>The hardest part was learning and using JavaScript AND learning Phaser at the same time.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Bouncing Phaser image: <a href="https://phaser.io/download/logo">Phaser logo</a></li>
<li>All art and sound from: <a href="https://opengameart.org/">here</a>.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<ul>
  <li> Dig for gold. </li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<ul>
  <li> Could the basic mechanic of digging around a top down map be fun. </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<ul>
  <li>I wanted to build something at least somewhat fun from a simple mechanic.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<ul>
  <li>Currently, the player can move around a map and 'dig' by pressing a defined action button. This increases there score by a flat amount.</li>
  <li>With time and aptitude to flesh this out, I would like to add the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Randomized items/point value found in tiles</li>
      <li>Upgrade system, a way to spend your 'score'</li>
      <li>Ability to place buildings that have different functions</li>
      <li>Some sort of 'end goal', like a certain score</li>
      <li>Combat? Random enemies appearing to fend off from your 'dig site'.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<ul>
  <li>Honestly the best strategy is to move and press 'E'.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<ul>
  <li>The game is abstract and is focused on the 'digging' mechanic.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<ul>
  <li>People who love digging.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<ul>
  <li>I think it would take a few minutes to press E on every tile.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
