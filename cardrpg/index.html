<h2>DICE</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<ul>
  <li>A twist on the DDR style game to attempt to make it a versus game.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<ul>
  <li>I took the 'balancing relationship/negative feedback' we talked about in class last week and implemented it.  The player that is currently losing gets to send notes quicker than their opponent.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<ul>
  <li>Much harder to playtest something that is only two players.</li>
  <li>Easiest part: Once I had an idea of what I wanted to happen the logic and implementation was very simple.</li>
  <li>Hardest part: I need to find a way to motivate players to actually send notes. Maybe the only way to score is to get notes past your opponent, not to match notes?</li>
  <li>^^^ I implemented the above without testing it so I hope that works out.^^^</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li> Art Source: My artistic genius </li>
<li> Ding sound: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/6-user-interface-ding-clicks"> ding.</a></li>
<li> Music: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mD9j5JIpdQ">youtube</a></li>


</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
  <li> Core gameplay resembles DDR.</li>
  <li> Iterated on: <a href="https://cleoman.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/ddcomp">game.</a></li>
  <li> ^^ Note: I forgot to make a copy of the last game and work from that so some of the changes implemented here are mirrored there. </li>
  <li> Just in case: new stuff is the balancing relationship, the music, and the feedback text that pops up in a player's play area.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<ul>
  <li> Compete with your friend in a DDR style game.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<ul>
  <li> </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<ul>
  <li>Input: Keyboard</li>
  <li>Randomness: Deterministic.</li>
  <li>Play style:  </li>
  <li>Genre: </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<ul>
  <li> I wanted players to have to balance when to be offensive and when to be 'defensive'. </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<ul>
  <li>Competitive drive to beat their opponent.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype’s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<ul>
  <li>Players can match notes sent by their opponent, and send notes to their opponent. Player 1 uses QWE to match notes and ASD to send notes, and player 2 uses UIO to match notes and JKL to send notes.</li>
  <li>I would like to progressively increase the speed at which you can send notes to your opponent. Right now it is locked at roughly 3/sec.</li>
  <li>^^Update on last bullet: The speed at which you can send notes has changed, but is changed according to your score to creative a balancing relationship.</li>
  <li>I would also like to add a rudimentary AI for lonely playtesters.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<ul>
  <li> I think playing as defensively as possible will be the most successful strategy.</li>
  <li> The way the speed at which you can send notes changes creates a new strategy: let your opponent get some notes by you and then spam them with notes at your increased speed. </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<ul>
  <li>No story.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<ul>
  <li>People who love DDR games.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<ul>
  <li>Minute - two minutes.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
